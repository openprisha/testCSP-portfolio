   <strong> Project: </strong> <p class="font-weight-light">Getaways </p>
      
        <strong> How it started: </strong> <p class="font-weight-light">Tech Cruh Disrupt</p><br>
        <strong> Duration: </strong> <p class="font-weight-light">From September 2015-Now </p>
        <strong> Objective: </strong> <p class="font-weight-light">This hackathon where startups were instructed to sign up to pitch their business ideas on a stage in front of venture capital investors, media and other interested parties for prize money and publicity. (any startup)</p> 
        <strong> Type of Project: </strong> <p class="font-weight-light">App/Startup <br> 
        <p class="font-weight-light">For this project, my father and I were instructed with a challenge to make and create a start-up in one night. Just being a 5th grader, I didnt really expect to recive anything, but with inspiration and huge help from my father, I made Getaways, an inbred travel app "brought to your wrist". The goal of the app was to be an easy way for tourists to book activities in an easy and accisible way. It is an app accesible to your apple watch and using Skyskanners hotel API kit, was able to have many feathures, such as 360 degree preveiw for each activity before the user books it, so its like they were there! This app on the Skyscanner award at the hackathon and won $1000 and was the start to this journey with Getaways. With my father as my partner, I was able to realease this app onto the app store, as it ended up grossing over 40,000 donloads, and is still active. See below for more on Getaways!! <strong>Click <a href="https://partners.skyscanner.net/news-case-studies/events/nurturing-young-talent-through-skyscanners-api">here</a> to go to my official interveiw and article with skyscanners board.</strong><br> <br>
