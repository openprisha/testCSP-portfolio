          <p class="font-weight-light"> My dream growing up was to be like my father and to code my own companies and to “rule the world with my ideas”. But even as a high school studant, my goals and priorities have stayed along that line. I have gained interest in Artificial Intelligence and Web Design and am planning on applying for projects and am in the process of releasing my own website. I have a passiion in the feild and wish to persue a career there. 
<br>
<br>
          To be in the field, passion and persistance is key and I believe anyone can persue a carrer in computer science but its really the drive to do it that I found to be the part that most miss. I started off with a broad mind as to what computer scince really was, and didnt really know where to start. It as then when I started attending coder dojo sessions at my local librabry and then I attended an all-girls summer coding school with Alexa Cafe 5 years ago, where I finally got that confidence to design, code and ship. To me, coding is like solving puzzles and playing games, but these games end up with really useful apps and tools for others.
<br>
<br>
          I then went on to participate and compete in multiple hackathons among even adults double my age. I then ended up making one of my most sucssesful startups hen I as just 10 years old, Getaways,  an innovative wearable travel planning app, using Skyskanners Hotels API to generate ‘trip experiences from your wrist’. This app grossed over 40,000 donloads, and was the start to my journey with coding in general. Thats why with my ambition and drive, it was possible to create game-changing product ideas and code to a high level despite not having years of experience or advanced training. That inspired me to end up mentoring others in my on time, through Coder Dojo sessions and robotics holding multiple workshops introducing others who where new like I was. 
      <br>
      <br>
          Alongside coding, I do rowing (crew novice jv team) as a hobbie where I have to go to practice everyday after school and balance out school, rowing, and normal home lifehich really test my time-managent skills on regular basis. At school, I participate in the engineering and desighn, Girls who Code, and Technovation clubs. As my my instrument, Tabla (an indian drum), I started playing it 2 yers ago and first started to get closer to my culture.
          <br>
          <br>
          Being an indian girl in the Bay Area and being surrounded with all sorts of the recources and oppertunities has really inspired me to here I stand today. In the future I hope to continue my persuit in the tech feild and hobbies. Thank you for taking the time to read a little bit about me and hope you check out the rest of my ebsite for more inforamtion and contact me in case you have any questions! </p>
