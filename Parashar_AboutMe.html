          <p class="font-weight-light"> My dream growing up was to be like my father, to code my own software projects, and to "change the world positively with my ideas”. Now, as a high school student, my goals and priorities have stayed along that same line. I have gained interest in Artificial Intelligence and Web Design and I am building and shipping applications to solve real problems in the world. I have a passion for technology and wish to pursue a career as a builder and an entrepreneur. 
<br>
<br>
          To be a computer scientist, passion and persistence are the keys. I started off with an open mind, without much knowledge about what computer science is. I didn't really know where to start. I started attending coder dojo sessions at my local library and then I attended an all-girls summer coding school with Alexa Cafe. There, I finally got that confidence to design, code and ship. To me, coding is like solving puzzles and playing games, but these games end up with really useful apps and tools for others.
<br>
<br>
          I then went on to participate and compete in multiple hackathons among seasoned adult engineers. I ended up making one of my most sucssesful startups when I was just 10 years old, Getaways. It is an innovative wearable travel planning app, using Skyskanners Hotels API to book ‘trip experiences from your wrist’. This app grossed over 40,000 downloads, and was the start to my journey with coding in general. With my ambition and drive, it was possible to create game-changing product ideas and code to a high level despite not having years of experience or advanced training. That inspired me to end up mentoring others in my on time, through Coder Dojo sessions and robotics holding multiple workshops introducing others who were new like I was. 
      <br>
      <br>
          Alongside coding, I do rowing (crew novice jv team), where I have to go to practice everyday after school and balance out school, rowing, and normal home life. It really tests my time-management skills on a regular basis. At school, I participate in the Girls who Code, and Technovation clubs. I play Tabla (an indian drum). I started playing it 2 years ago and allowed me to get closer to my roots and culture, from where my parents originated.
          <br>
          <br>
          Being a young girl growing up in the Bay Area, and being surrounded with all sorts of the recources and opportunities has really inspired me to get where I stand today. In the future, I hope to continue my pursuit in the field of technology and social ventures. Thank you for taking the time to read a little bit about me and hope you check out the rest of my website for more information. Contact me in case I can help with anyting. </p>
